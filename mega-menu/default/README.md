# Default Code

1. Either copy the JS into the site.js.twig file, or include it using: `{% include "path/to/file" %}`.
2. Copy the contents of the CSS file into css/modules/nav.css so that it overrides the existing navbar css.
3. Edit html/sections/header.html.twig and add the class "mega-menu" to the main nav element (the one that has a class of "header-nav")
