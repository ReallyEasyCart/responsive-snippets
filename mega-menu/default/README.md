# Default Code

1. Overwrite js/modules/nav.js with mega-menu.js so that the default JS doesn't interfere.
2. Overwrite css/modules/nav.css with mega_menu.css so that the default CSS doesn't interfere.
3. Edit html/sections/header.html.twig and add the class "mega-menu" to the main nav element (the one that has a class of "header-nav")
