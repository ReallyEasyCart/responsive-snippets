# Mega Menu

Fully responsive mega menu with only a tiny bit of JS

## What is Default and Custom?

The code in the Default folder will convert an existing REC Menu into a mega menu without having to change any HTML. The code in the Custom folder is an example of how you can alter the HTML/CSS to create a more custom mega menu.

The Custom Example also shows how I dealt with the Secondary Nav Bar.
