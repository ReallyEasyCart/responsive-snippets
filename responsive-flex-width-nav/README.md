# Flexibly Spaced Nav Links

This small bit of CSS will dynamically space the links in a navbar using flex. This will only work in modern browsers (see http://caniuse.com/flexbox), meaning that you may need to adjust the padding for older browsers. Some examples of this in use are Postbox Shop, Hiroboy & Motorcycle Exhausts.

## Using the Responsive Flex Width Nav

1. All you need to do is either copy the CSS into the site.css.twig file, or import it using: `{% import "path/to/file" %}`
