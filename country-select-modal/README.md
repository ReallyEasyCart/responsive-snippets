# Custom Code

This is the exact code that we used to create a GDPR compliant country select modal which identifies visitors by their IP address and then pops a modal, offering them the choice of going to the appropriate site for their geography (being the UK, US or Asia).

## How to Install

1. Include the CSS and all Javascript files in the head like in index.html.

2. Edit the configuration block at the top of country-select-modal.js to point to the images and set the API Key for IP-API.
